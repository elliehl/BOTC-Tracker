This project tracks my stats from Blood on the Clocktower. It will initially display my stats as a player, including games played, wins, and win percentages both overall and sorted by character, character type, and alignment. Once this has been completed I will add the stats from games I have run as a storyteller, including the most played roles, wins by alignment, and stats for players playing in those games.

It is created using Next.js, Typescript, Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.
